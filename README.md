# xCyclopedia
Encyclopedia for Executables

## What is xCyclopedia?
The xCyclopedia project attempts to document all executable binaries (and eventually scripts) that reside on a typical operating system. Currently, this includes all observed EXE and DLL files, as well as COM Objects *(new!)*. It provides a [web page](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia) to view the data as well as a [machine-readable format](/output) (JSON and CSV) that can be immediately usable in other systems such as SIEMs to enrich observed executions with contextual data.

## What data points are available?

* Runtime data (Standard Out, Standard Error, Children Processes, Screenshots, Open Handles, Loaded Modules, Window Title)
* File metadata (File Description, Original File Name, Product Name, Comments, Company Name, File Version, Product Version, Copyright, PE Machine Type)
* Digital signature validity and associated metadata (Serial, Thumbprint, Issuer, Subject)
* File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, IMP, PESHA1, PE256)
* Fuzzy file hash (ssdeep)
* Similar files* (available on [xCyclopedia web page](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia) only)
* External References* (available on [xCyclopedia web page](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia) only)
  * Examples of misuse (e.g. malicious use of legitimate executable)
  * Microsoft Documentation
* File scan results (VirusTotal)
* DLL Exported Functions (DLL files only)
* (NEW!) COM Objects (CLSID, Friendly Names, Mappings to EXE/DLLs, Exposed methods/properties, other metadata) - Gathered via [Get-ComObjects](script/Get-ComObjects.ps1)

## How is this done?

The results provided in the [output](/output) directory were gathered in virtual machines of various Windows OS versions and patch levels (currently a very manual process). For your own usage, it is always recommended these scripts be first executed in test environments.

### Get-Xcyclopedia
The [Get-Xcyclopedia](script/Get-Xcyclopedia.ps1) script iterates recursively through all directories and starts any executables found. It then gathers a multitude of artifacts (which is slowly being improved). For example, it grabs the command line output, in search of helpful syntax messages. And if a window is visible, it will take a screenshot.

### Get-ComObjects
The [Get-ComObjects](script/Get-ComObjects.ps1) script iterates through each CLSID and enumerates its associated registry keys and exposed methods/properties. 

## Where is this data stored?

#### JSON/CSV
For the machine-readable data (JSON & CSV):
* EXE Data
  * [strontic-xcyclopedia.json.zip](output/strontic-xcyclopedia.json.zip)
  * [strontic-xcyclopedia.csv.zip](output/strontic-xcyclopedia.csv.zip)
* DLL Data
  * [strontic-xcyclopedia_DLL.json.zip](output/strontic-xcyclopedia_DLL.json.zip)
  * [strontic-xcyclopedia_DLL.csv.zip](output/strontic-xcyclopedia_DLL.csv.zip)
* COM-Object Data
  * [strontic-xcyclopedia_COM.json.zip](output/strontic-xcyclopedia_COM.json.zip)

#### Web Page (Markdown)
For a web-based view of the data click here: [strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia). *Note: the web view includes a few bonus features that the JSON/CSV files do not currently include; namely the following:*
* Examples of known malicious use of a given executable (current sources: [atomic-red-team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team), [LOLBAS](https://github.com/LOLBAS-Project/LOLBAS), [malware-ioc](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc), [Sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma), and [Signature-Base](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base))
* File comparisons/similarities (using [ssdeep](https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep/releases/tag/release-2.14.1))
* Relevant [Microsoft documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs).

## Can I collect this data myself?

Sure! The powershell scripts are [here](/script)! See syntax/usage section below.

## Collector Script Usage

### Syntax

 ```powershell
  Get-Xcyclopedia
  #Synopsis: Iterate through all executable files in a specified directory (default target is .EXE). Gather CLI usage/syntax, screenshots, file hashes, file metadata, signature validity, and child processes.
    -save_path                  #path to save output
    -target_path                #target path for enumerating files (non-recursive). Comma-delimited for multiple paths.
    -target_path_recursive      #target path for enumerating files (recursive). Comma-delimited for multiple paths.
    -target_file_extension      #File extension to target (default = ".exe")
    -execute_files    [bool]    #Execute each for gathering syntax/usage info (stdout/stderr)
    -take_screenshots [bool]    #Take a screenshot if a given process has a window visible. This requires execute_files to be enabled.
    -minimize_windows [bool]    #Minimizing windows helps with screenshots, so that other windows do not get in the way. This only takes effect if execute_files and $take_screenshots are both enabled.
    -xcyclopedia_verbose   [bool] #Verbose Output
    -transcript_file       [bool] #Write console output to a file (job.txt)

### **Optional** Dependencies:
* *ssdeep*: For obtaining ssdeep fuzzy hashes (useful for finding similar files). You must extract the ssdeep ZIP file (available [here](https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep/releases/download/release-2.14.1/ssdeep-2.14.1-win32-binary.zip)) into a subfolder called "bin/ssdeep-2.14.1".
* *Sysinternals Handle*: For obtaining the open handles of a given process. You must place `handle64.exe` (available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle)) in a subfolder called "bin/sysinternals/handle".
* *Sysinternals Sigcheck*: For obtaining additional file hashes, VirusTotal detections, and PE machine-type. You must place `sigcheck64.exe` (available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck)) in a subfolder called "bin/sysinternals/sigcheck".
* *DLL Export Viewer*: For obtaining Exported Functions from DLLs. You must place `dllexp.exe` (available [here](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html)) in a subfolder called "bin/dllexp-x64".

## How can I contribute?
* Share it with friends
* Provide feedback

## TODO
- Convince a linux/macos guru to script this for other OS's :)
- Use a more reliable method for determining children processes (and for stopping them)
- Use Logman.exe (or equivalent) to determine which ETW providers are being populated by a given process.
- Use SilkETW (or equivalent) for vastly improved runtime metadata gathering. 
- Identify runtime deltas in different executable versions. (e.g. when a new command-line switch is added to the standard output)
